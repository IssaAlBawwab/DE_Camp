# Data Engineering Zoom Camp - Follow Along

This repository contains my work and notes as I follow along with the [Data Engineering Zoom Camp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp). The camp is a hands-on learning program designed to help participants gain practical experience in data engineering.

## About the Zoom Camp
The Data Engineering Zoom Camp covers a wide range of topics in data engineering, including:
- Data ingestion
- Data transformation
- Data storage
- Data orchestration
- Data visualization
- And more!

Each week focuses on a specific topic, with hands-on exercises and projects to reinforce learning.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by week, with each folder containing notes, code, and exercises for that week's topic.
